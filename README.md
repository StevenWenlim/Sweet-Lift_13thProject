# Sweet-Lift_13thProject
A taxi company named Sweet Lift has collected historical data on taxi orders at the airport. As a Data Scientist, I have been asked to create a model that can predict the number of taxi orders for the next hour with the hope of attracting more drivers during peak hours. The evaluation metric RMSE on the test set should not be more than 48.

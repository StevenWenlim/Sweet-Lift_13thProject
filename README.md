# Sweet-Lift_13thProject
A taxi company named Sweet Lift has collected historical data on taxi orders at the airport. As a Data Scientist, I have been asked to create a model that can predict the number of taxi orders for the next hour with the hope of attracting more drivers during peak hours. The evaluation metric RMSE on the test set should not be more than 48.

Based on the results of creating models using RandomForest, LightGBM, and CatBoost, it can be concluded that the RandomForest model produces the best prediction performance among the three models with an RMSE value of 21.2 and processing speed of 1.63 seconds, while the LightGBM model has the fastest processing speed at 0.41 seconds and an RMSE value of 27.

Therefore, I recommend that Sweet Lift company use the RandomForest model to predict the number of taxi orders for the next hour. The model with a higher RMSE value was chosen to balance the needs of customers with the availability of the fleet, with the hope of improving service for customer satisfaction.
